<h3>Master Mobile UX - Notes</h3>
<p>-‘Rewire’ is the right word! I have always, always ignored instructions when told to design mobile first because I never wanted to change the way my brain worked. My brain immediately saw the desktop design, not the mobile. But then it was so difficult to change the design to fit the mobile view! I paid better attention to how I view sites on a daily basis-and the only time I used my desktop was for my classwork. For everything else I used my phone! So I’m committed to rewire-ing my brain for Mobile First!
    -“Just because your website is responsive, doesn’t mean it’s mobile first”…… whaaaaaat?

 <p><b>Remember:</b></p>
 <ul>
     <li>Start small and scale up</li>
     <li>Ensures that you’re really concentrating on your content and your functionality to make sure things are going to work well on small devices.</li>
 </ul> 

 <h4>Better Mobile Design</h4>
 <ol>
     <li>Be there</li>
     <li>Be Useful</li>
     <li>Be Quick</li>
 </ol>

 <h4>Reachability Matters</h4>
 <ul>
	<li>Users will use their phones one handed</li>
	<li>Larger screen (tablet) make it easy to reach (thumbs are on the bottom)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Speed/Network Matters</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Not everybody has the latest and greatest</li>
	<li>1/2 second delay = 20% drop in traffic</li>
    <li>Reduce image usage </li>
	<li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth</li>
	<li>Optimize and Minify CSS and JS </li>
	<li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>

<h4>Perception Matters - Reduce cognitive load</h4>
	<p>Hamburger icon vs MENU button (+20% clicks</p>)

<h4>Mobile Friendly Forms</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Amount of information asked of users</li>
	<li>Ditch labels-have them appear in fields</li>
	<li>Float labels</li>
	<li>Increase field size (thumb size)</li>
	<li>Autocomplete </li>
	<li>Show passwords (but allow users to hide if wanted)</li>
	<li>Appropriate keyboards </li>
    </ul>

<h4>Mobile Ads</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Keep them small, simple/sleek</li>
	<li>Stop using Pop-ups/overs</li>
	<li>use advertising sparingly</li>
	<li>Make sure it’s unobtrusive </li>
    </ul>
