  <h2>Chapter 8: CSS3 TRansforms and Transitions</h2>
  <p>I have used CSS3 annimation many times before, so instead of writing down notes for something I am already familiar with,<br>
     I wanted to show my work on some exercises this week. However the examples/exercises from the reading didn't really work for me because <br>
    it didn't provide the complete html, and I noticed the CSS referenced classes and ids that weren't mentioned in this chapter, so instead of <br>
having to go back and read previous chapters, I thought I would create two exercises of my own. </p>
<p id="highlight">I do say this on my transitions link, but I was hoping you could specifically take a look at my wiggle class? I couldn't figure out how to <br>
get it working? </p>
